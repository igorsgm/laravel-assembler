## 0️⃣ Requirements

- Mandatory:
    - PHP 7.3 or higher
    - Composer
    
    > Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your $PATH so the `laravel-assembler` executable can be located by your system.
    This directory exists in different locations based on your operating system; however, some common locations include:
    > - macOS: `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`
    > - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
    > - GNU / Linux Distributions: `$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin` or `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`

- Optional:
    - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) with your user properly [logged in](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login): to create the repository for your new project -- *the logged in user is going to be the owner of the repo*.
    - [gitflow-avh](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh): to start git flow in your project.
    - [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet): to set up a SSL certificate and open the project in the browser automatically.
    - [Jetbrains CLI's](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/working-with-the-ide-features-from-command-line.html) Launcher for a standalone instance: if you wish to open the project immediately on PhpStorm.
